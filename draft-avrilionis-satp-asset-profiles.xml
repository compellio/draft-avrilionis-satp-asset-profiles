    <abstract>
      <t> A definition of asset schema and profiles is needed to provide a
      semantic definition of tokenized assets. The Asset schema is an abstract
      construct at the root hierarchy of more specific "asset profiles". Asset
      profiles describe the structure (type) of assets that are specific to a given
      domain or industry. An asset instance that is instantiated in a specific
      network and is exchanged via the SATP protocol has an instance-class
      relationship (in an ontological sense) with a given profile. Asset
      profiles are essential to the SATP protocol as they define the semantics
      of asset instances to be transferred. Gateways may negotiate asset
      transfers based on the nature and abilities of the assets as defined according
      to their profile. The current document discusses the definition of the asset schema
      and profile.</t>
    </abstract>

    <note title="Editorial Note">
      <t> Discussion of this draft takes place on the SATP mailing list
      (sat@ietf.org), which has its home page at <eref
      target="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/satp/about/"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t> Asset transfer protocols such as SATP <xref target="SATP-ARCH"/>
      utilize gateways to transfer tokenized assets from one network to
      another. In such transfers, the semantic definition of tokenisable
      assets is the basis for negotiating the transfer conditions among
      gateways.</t>

      <t>The semantic definition of the tokenizable real-world assets is
      referred to as the asset definition schema (or "asset schema" for
      short). Certain industry verticals or narrow use cases may define a
      subset of the larger asset definition schema. These derived schemas are
      called schema-profiles (or simply "profile").</t>

      <t>Asset schemas and profiles are defined using JSON-LD syntax.
      Tokenised Assets are JSON data structures that refer to Asset Profiles
      using the "@context" construct.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="asset_schema" title="Asset Schema">
      <t> The Asset Schema is the top construct in the hierarchy of asset
      profiles. It defines a set of namespaces relevant to the definition of
      asset profiles (e.g. Schema.org, W3C SKOS, XML XSD, etc.). It also
      defines the structure of generic constructs that are related to the
      overall architecture of Asset Profiles and Registries. Two of such
      constructs have been identified so far, namely the "Organisation Key" and the "Facets". </t>

      <section anchor="organisation_key" title="Organisation key">
        <t> An organisation key is the definition of the public key of an organisation and
        applies to all asset profiles. Such key may be used to sign data in the exchange
        between an Asset Provider and a Registry (see <xref target="SATP-ASSET-ARCH"/> for
        the related vocabulary). An organisation key is composed of a public key elements and a
        date of issuance of the public key. This basic construct may be extended with additional
        elements, for example, the end of validity date of the key.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="facets" title="Facets">
        <t> Facets are important elements of the overall architecture of
        Schemas and Profiles. They refer to systemic qualities of an asset and
        play an important role in the negotiation phase among Gateways, prior
        to the execution of SATP. Examples of facets are: </t>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <t> Network transferability: information related to which networks
            can host a given asset. </t>
          </li>

          <li>
            <t> Owner transferability: information related to the ability to
            transfer ownership of an asset. </t>
          </li>

          <li>
            <t> Tradeability: information related to the way an asset can be
            exchanged with another. For example, an asset provider can state
            that the asset cannot be traded for bitcoin. </t>
          </li>

          <li>
            <t>Taxability: information related to the way an asset can be
            taxed in specific jurisdictions </t>
          </li>

          <li>
            <t>Collateralisability: information related to the way an asset
            can be collateralised </t>
          </li>

          <li>
            <t>Confiscatability: information related to the ability of given
            entities to confiscate the asset in given jurisdictions </t>
          </li>

          <li>
            <t>Jurisdiction: information about the jurisdiction applicable to
            the assets related to the given profile</t>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <t>It should be noted that the Asset Schema introduces the notion of
        facet as an empty namespace. Relevant facets would be defined at the
        level of the Asset Profile.</t>

    <section anchor="asset_profile" title="Asset Profile">
      <t> Asset Profiles are definitions of the "types" of assets. Asset Profiles may define
      a great variety of assets in different industries. Asset Profiles are referenced by Tokenised Asset Records (TARs)
      <xref target="SATP-ASSET-ARCH"/> . As TARs are defined JSON, a TAR can reference an Asset Profile using the
      @context construct like any ordinary reference to a JSON-LD.
      </t>

      <t>For illustration purposes, in this document, we use
      the example of an Asset Profile defining a "Digitized Cultural Asset Passport". A Cultural
      Asset Passport can be seen as a certificate that is issued by a public authority in a
      given jurisdiction, uniquely defining the specific asset. A Digitized Cultural Asset Passport
      stored in a Registry <xref target="SATP-ASSET-ARCH"/>  allows Gateways to verify the validity
      of the asset in a given network and therefore to proceed to the transfer of the Digitized Cultural
      Asset Passport via the execution of the SATP protocol. In order for such verifications to occur a
      public key of the Asset Authority (see  <xref target="SATP-ASSET-ARCH"/> for vocabulary) is also
      included in the Asset Profile. In the example below, the Asset Authority
      (culture.example.org) defines its public key so any kind of data signature with
      such a key (e.g. using a JSON Web Signature - RFC 7515 mechanism) can be independently verified.</t>

      <t>As it can be seen in the example below and according to the overall Asset Schema and Profile
      Architecture defined in <xref target="SATP-ASSET-ARCH"/>, the Digitized Cultural Asset Passport (DCAP) is a
      Tokenised Asset Record (TAR), composed of a set of attributes related to the Real-World Asset (RWA)
      as well as another set of attributes related to the Digitized Asset Record (DAR).</t>

    <section anchor="implementation" title="Implementation considerations">
       <t>Validating a Tokenised Asset Record against a given Asset Profile shall follow the general JSON-LD
       validation process (see <eref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/"/>). However, implementors can
       add extra validation steps in order to verify the consistency of information stored in a Registry.
       In the example above, instead of adding a plain URL reference in the @content element like a regular json-ld,
       we show an example of a reference to the asset profile as URN. Fetching the asset profile from a Registry
       based on that URN, an asset profile validator can perform the series of checks defined in the section "Working
